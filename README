This toolchain is confirmed to work the the STM32F1- and STM32F4-Discovery boards.

Usage: Hit make and wait
Destination is overwritable by specifying TOOLCHAIN_ROOTDIR as a paramter to make
Use V=1 for verbose mode
Use CPUS=<number> to specify the number of threads. If not specified the Makefile will try to figure it out by itself
Do not use -j for the main Makefile!

example: make TOOLCHAIN_ROOTDIR=/home/user/mytoolchain

Other make targets:
	download: Fetch all sources, but don't extract or build them
	clean: Removed build-tmp directory containing temporary build files
	distclean: Like clean, but also removes downloaded source code

Dependencies (at least): libmpc, libgmp, libmpfr, libusb
